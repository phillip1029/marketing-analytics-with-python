    "# Chapter 3 Feature Engineering for Marketing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter, we learned how to preprocess and explore our marketing data using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Now, we'll dive into feature engineering, a crucial step in the data science workflow that involves creating new and informative features from existing data to improve the predictive power of our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering is particularly important in marketing analytics, as it helps us capture more complex patterns and relationships in customer behavior and market trends. In this chapter, we'll explore various techniques for creating new features using Python and apply them to our Online Retail dataset.\n",

    "### 3.1 Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) Analysis\n",
    "One of the most common feature engineering techniques in marketing is Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis. RFM analysis segments customers based on three key metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recency: How recently a customer made a purchase\n",
    "- Frequency: How often a customer makes purchases\n",
    "- Monetary: How much a customer spends\n",
